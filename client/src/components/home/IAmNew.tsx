    "question": "Who am I?",
    "answer": "Am I the body, mind or something more? These are the age old questions that every philosopher throughout the ages has tried to grasp and understand.\n\nSrimad-Bhagavatam (7.2.22) explains that the spirit soul has no death and is eternal and inexhaustible. He is completely different from the material body, but because of being misled by misuse of his slight independence, he is obliged to accept subtle and gross bodies created by the material energy and thus be subjected to so-called material happiness and distress.\n\nAlso Mundaka Upanishad (3.1.9) explains that the living being is the soul, and that:\n\"The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited.\"\n\nThe Katha Upanishad relates that within the body, higher than the senses and the sense objects, exists the mind. More subtle than the mind is the intelligence, and higher and more subtle than the intellect is the self. That self is hidden in all beings and does not shine forth, but is seen by subtle seers through their sharp intellect."

    "question": "What is the goal of life?",
    "answer": "All of us are looking for love. However, we are trying to search for so called love in this material world – a world which is full of greed, envy, lust, anger, false ego and illusion. This material world is full of sorrow and misery. It is a temporary world. One can land into problems at any step. Thus our attempts to find real happiness in this material world invariably ends up in frustration. Real happiness can be found when we reawaken the dormant love or Krishna consciousness. Human life is a chance for us to reestablish this relationship.\nKrishna consciousness is achieved by always thinking of Him by chanting His holy name, serving him, serving his devotees and by spreading the glories of holy name. Thus, when we are engaged in Krishna consciousness, we experience the highest transcendental love – love of Krishna, the Supreme personality of Godhead or prema bhakti. Achieving prema bhakti is the goal of life. A life of eternity, knowledge and bliss!"

    "question": "What is Karma?",
    "answer": "As we know Newton's third law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. On the universal scale, this is the law of karma. The law of karma basically states that every action has a reaction and whatever you do to others will later return to you. Furthermore, ignorance of the law is no excuse. We are still accountable for everything we do, regardless of whether we understand it or not. Therefore, the best thing is to learn how it works.\n\nIf everyone understood the law of karma, we would all be living a happier life in a brighter world. Why? Because we could know how to adjust our lives so we would not be suffering the constant reactions of what we have done due to the false aims of life.\n\nAccording to Vedic literature, Karma is produced by performing fruitive activities for bodily or mental development. One may perform pious activities that will produce good reactions or good karma for future enjoyment. Or one may perform selfish or what some call sinful activities that produce bad karma and future suffering. This follows a person wherever he or she goes in this life or future lives. Such karma, as well as the type of consciousness a person develops, establishes reactions that one must experience.\n\nThe Svetashvatara Upanishad (5.12) explains that the living being, the jiva soul, acquires many gross physical and subtle bodies due to the actions he performs, as is motivated by the material qualities to which he obtains. These bodies that are acquired continue to be a source of illusion as long as he is ignorant of his real identity.\nSimilarly, it is stated that as a man sows, so shall he reap. Therefore, as people live their present life, they cultivate a particular type of consciousness by their thoughts and activities, which may be good or bad. This creates a person’s karma."

  {
    "question": "What is Reincarnation?",
    "answer": "Reincarnation is called samsara, The word samsara is Sanskrit and means being bound to the cycle of repeated birth and death through numerous lifetimes. How this works is that those who are materially conditioned transmigrate through different bodies according to one’s desires and past activities (or karma) and familiarities. Their desires, if materially motivated, requires a physical body to enable them to continue to work out their material longings in various conditions of life.\n\nBhagavad-gita (8.6) explains that whatever state of consciousness one attains when he or she quits this body, a similar state will be attained in the next life. This means that after the person has lived his or her life, the numerous variegated activities of the person forms an aggregated consciousness. All of our thoughts and actions throughout our life will collectively influence the state of being we are in at the time of death. This consciousness will determine what that person is thinking of at the end of one’s life. This last thought and consciousness will then direct where that person will most likely go in the next life because this state of being carries over from this life into the next.\n\nThe Svetashvatara Upanishad (5.12) explains that the living being (the jiva soul), acquires many gross physical and subtle bodies due to the actions he performs, as is motivated by the material qualities to which he obtains. These bodies that are acquired continue to be a source of illusion as long as he is ignorant of his real identity.\nSimilarly, it is stated that as a man sows, so shall he reap. Therefore, as people live their present life, they cultivate a particular type of consciousness by their thoughts and activities, which may be good or bad. This creates a person’s karma."

    "question": "What is Vedic Culture?",
    "answer": "By investigating the knowledge and viewpoints in the many topics found in Vedic culture we can certainly see that the practice and utilization of this Vedic knowledge can indeed assist us in many ways, even in this 21st century. In regard to all the trouble we presently see in this world, maybe it is time to look at things through a different and deeper view to find the answers and directions that are so needed. The knowledge and understandings of this great Vedic culture may indeed be what will help us see through the fog of confusion that seems to envelope so much of society.\n\nIndia and its Vedic culture has contributed much to the world, such as its music, beautiful forms of art and architecture, martial arts, astronomy, holistic medicine in Ayurveda, and the mathematical system based on the number ten, along with its yoga systems and philosophy.\n\nVedic mathematics is another example of its contribution to world progress Without the advancements in math that had been established by Vedic culture as far back as 2500 BC and passed along to others, such as the Greeks and Romans, we would not have many of the developments and inventions that we enjoy today. The Greek alphabet, for example, was a great hindrance to calculating.\n\nThe numeral script from India is said to have evolved from the Brahmi numerals. This spread to Arabia through traders and merchants, and from there up into Europe and elsewhere. It became known as the Arabic numerals, yet the Arabians had called them “Indian figures” (Al-Arqan-Al-Hindu) and the system of math was known as hindisat, or the Indian art.\n\nA well-developed medical system was in existence well before the 1st century A.D. Ayurveda is the Vedic system of holistic medicine. The word “Ayurveda”, translated from Sanskrit, is composed of two words, ‘Ayus’ which means life and ‘Veda’ which denotes knowledge. So Ayurveda is the knowledge of healthy living and is not only the treatment of diseases. Ayurveda has twin objectives–maintaining the health of the healthy, and cure illnesses of the diseased.\n\nJyotish is the Vedic form of astrology, which is an ancient science and is also being accepted and gaining popularity in the West. Vedic Astrology is meant to help the individual better find his or her way through life.\n\nVãstu is the Vedic science of architectural and home arrangement. It made its way through the orient and became known as Feng Shui, which has become popular in the West.\n\nVedic paintings or symbols are unique in that they can deliver the same spiritual energy, vibration and insight that it represents. In other words, through the meditation and devotional mood of the artist, the art becomes a manifestation of the higher reality.\n\nAs with art, dance in India was not merely an expression of an artist’s emotional mindset or imagination, but was meant to be an interpretation or conveyance of higher spiritual principles or pastimes of the Divine. In fact, in the Vedic pantheon Shiva is known as Nataraja, the king of dancers. Shiva’s dance was also not without a more significant purpose. His dance was based on the rhythm of cosmic energy that pervades the universe, and the destruction of the illusory energy by which all souls are given the opportunity for release from the illusion to attain liberation, moksha.\n\nIn this way, traditional Indian dance is highly spiritual and often accompanies important religious rituals and holy days and festivals. Vedic dance goes back to prehistoric times. Bharata Muni wrote his Natya Shastra, science of drama and dance, over 2000 years ago. In it he explains that it was Lord Brahma, the secondary engineer of the universal creation, who brought dance (natya) and drama to the people of Earth millions of years ago, shortly after the Earth was created.\n\nWhen the dance is performed according to the spiritual standards, which some view as similar to the practice of yoga, even the dancers can invoke a high degree of spirituality in their own consciousness and bring unity between their inner selves and God.\n\nSo, as we can see, Vedic culture and its many areas of knowledge and devotional expression are still as relevant today as it was thousands of years ago. And humanity can benefit from it by introspection and in spiritual as well as material development as it did in the past.\n\nThe power and relevance of Vedic culture are found in the number of tools it has always provided in order for humanity to reach its fullest potentials, both as individuals who are searching for their own fulfillment and spiritual awakening, and as a society that can function in harmony with nature and cooperation amongst themselves."

    "question": "What happens if you die and there′s actually nothing there?",
    "answer": "In modern western philosophy, betting that God actually exists because it involves less risk is called Pascal’s Wager. The argument is named after the seventeenth century French mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623-62) who said that every one of us is in fact betting that either God exists or that He doesn’t. He urges us to bet that He does, since if we do, and He does exist, it will lead to eternal life. We will have led a good life and only have lost a little income or perhaps some personal pleasure along the way.\n\nBut if we use our life in denial of Him – in effect betting that He doesn’t exist – we may lose everything in the life after this.\n\nHare and Krishna (Hare is pronounced Huh-ray) are the first two words of a great mantra mentioned in the Vedas, and the mantra recited by Krishna people each day. It goes like this:\n\nHare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare\nHare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare\n\nKrishna means ‘all attractive,’ and Hare means ‘the eternal energy.’ The other word is Rama (pronounced like ‘drama’) which means ‘supreme pleasure.’ A mantra is a sound formula with the potency to uplift and enlighten those who repeat it. The word is derived from mana (the mind) and trayate (to protect and free). The ultimate reality is described in the Vedas by many names, and Hare, Krishna and Rama are three of those names. When the first Americans and Europeans saw Salon the devotees of Krishna in the 1960s they termed them the ‘Hare Krishna Movement’ or ‘The Hare Krishnas,’ and the name has stuck."

    "question": "What is the Bhagavad-Gita?",
    "answer": "The title is a Sanskrit phrase which means “Song of God.” If we can enjoy, grow, and learn from the songs of ordinary people, just imagine how much we can get out of the lyric sheet of the Original Artist and Musician, Krishna.\n\nJust like most songs start out with an intro, the Gita begins with a little background information. When the second part kicks in, Krishna starts singing. About what? Sincerity. Who is the real me? How can I do the right thing? What is the right thing to do?\n\nThis song is in Sanskrit (English didn’t even exist back then.). That could present a big problem. Fortunately the Gita’s lyrics have been translated.\n\nI’ve always loved getting albums that come with lots of inserts and explanations on what the band is all about. The Gita is like that. When the song first came out, over 5000 years ago, the scene was a lot more introspective than what we’ve got today. What they easily understood then goes soaring right over our heads. So the extra info on the lyrics is especially important.\n\nThe Gita has been bootlegged up and down over the centuries. Most of the different versions have a pretty descent translation of the lyrics. But many don’t come with the inserts and juicy info.\n\nSome explanation-inserts are better that others. Which ones are best? The ones that are most consistent with the song as a whole, and with Krishna’s other songs.\n\nSince the Gita first came out, there have been a few good releases. But they’ve all been out of circulation for decades. The best pressing available today is, by far, the Bhagavad-Gita As It Is, by Srila Prabhupada. It comes with the English translations as well as Krishna’s original Sanskrit lyrics, a word for word breakdown, and a detailed explanation for most of the verses."

    "question": "What is Hare Krishna movement?",
    "answer": "The Hare Krishna movement is the popular name for the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Founded in 1966 by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, ISKCON carries on in the modern world a great ancient tradition rooted in the Bhagavad-Gita, the teachings Lord Krishna spoke five thousand years ago. The Gita and the other Vedic scriptures declare Krishna to be the original person, God Himself, who appears periodically in this world to liberate all living beings.\n\nOnly five hundred years ago, Krishna descended as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to teach the most sublime and effective means of meditation for the present day: the chanting of the names of God, especially as found in the Hare Krishna mantra.\n\nToday, members of ISKCON continue Lord Caitanya’s movement by distributing the teachings of Lord Krishna and the Hare Krishna mantra all over the world."

    "question": "Who is Srila Prabhupada?",
    "answer": "From 1966 to 1977 His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (Srila Prabhupada), together with his disciples and followers, spread Krishna-consciousness all over the world. In just twelve years, in spite of his advanced age, he circled the globe fourteen times on lecture tours that took him to six continents. In spite of such a rigorous schedule, Srila Prabhupada continued to write prolifically. His writings constitute a veritable library of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature and culture. There are predictions from Srila Bhaktivinoda and in Sri Caitanya Mangala that point to Srila Prabhupada, his worldwide preaching of the holy name (sankirtan) and the emergence of the universal church of sankirtan, which is going to replace sectarian churches, teachers or religions that make the people of the world enemies to each other.\nWant to know more about Srila Prabhupada?"

  {
    "question": "What are your basic teachings?",
    "answer": "In a very small nutshell they are as follows: The soul is spirit and the body is matter. The body is a vehicle for the soul. The body is temporary but the soul endures. The soul is never born and never dies. It is unchanging, primeval and a spiritual spark of life within the body. The soul is conscious and blissful by nature. When the soul identifies with matter it mistakenly imagines that the body is the self. In its original state the soul is unlimitedly happy, but when it forgets its divine nature it struggles to achieve even temporary pleasure.\n\nThe soul is looking for the happiness it once had but in the wrong place. Just as the sunshine comes from the Sun, so the souls emanate from the supreme source. That ultimate reality is known in the Vedas as Brahman, Narayana or Krishna. That Godhead is not merely an impersonal energy, but the energetic source of all existence. The souls are infinite and dependent on Godhead, just as the rays depend on the Sun.\n\nGod has attributes such as a form and beauty. God has compassion and love. All souls emanate from the Supreme Being and share his loving nature, as sparks emanating from a fire share, in a very small degree, the fire’s heat and light. Some souls leave their relationship with the Supreme to experience life apart in the world of matter.\n\nOver countless births, layers of psychic conditioning cover their remembrance of their original nature and the hearts of these forgetful or ‘conditioned’ souls grow hard. By hearing the spiritual messages such as in the Bhagavad-gita, and applying them in their lives, the hearts of those souls will once again become soft and they will return to their original home with the Supreme."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do you mean by the word ′soul′?",
    "answer": "The word ‘soul’ is an English version of the Sanskrit word atma, which means ‘the self.’ The atma is the source of consciousness in the body. The body is a complex arrangement of chemicals, none of which are conscious. The body is the unconscious, external covering of the conscious soul."
  },
  {
    "question": "How would you define real happiness?",
    "answer": "When the pleasure is material it’s temporary, it has a beginning and an end, and it results in frustration. Because of this, material pleasure can never lead to a sense of fulfilment. We’ll always be left wanting more – and that’s a shame, because there’s a much better way to be happy. The Bhagavad-gita says that we’ll be happier enjoying a permanent pleasure that comes from deep within and which doesn’t depend on external things."

  {
    "question": "What is meditation?",
    "answer": "Meditation means to hold one thought within the mind for a period of time; to deeply contemplate it, even to become absorbed in it to the exclusion of all other thoughts. The original yoga texts say that the mind is constantly fluctuating from thought to thought. One thought leads to another, and another – a chain of thoughts. These thoughts come from sensory stimulation from our current environment, or they can come, unexpectedly, from incidents in our past lives.\n\nThe total effect is like ripples on a lake of water. The yogis say that the bottom of the lake is where you have dropped a precious golden ring, but the constant waves of thought prevent you from seeing any deeper than the surface. Meditation stills the waves of thought and allows you to see your deeper self."

    "question": "What scripture do we follow?",
    "answer": "Members of the Hare Krishna Movement follow ancient India’s Vedic literature, primarily Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. These teachings date back over 5000 years and are practiced by more than 900 million people today."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where the teachings originate from?",
    "answer": "Although the Hare Krishna Movement has only been established in the West since 1966, its roots extend thousands of years into the past, back into the Vedic tradition of India. The Vedas were originally a vocal tradition, but then were written in Sanskrit over 5000 years ago.\n\nThe compiler of the Vedic literature, Srila Vyasadeva, divided the Vedic knowledge into various departments of material and spiritual knowledge, entrusting his disciples with particular sections. In this way, the scriptures developed into the four Vedes, the Vedanta Sutras, 108 main Upanishads, the great Mahabharat which includes the Bhagavad-gita, and the 18 major Puranas, among other texts. Of the Puranas, the Bhagavat Purana or Srimad-Bhagavatam is described as the most ripened fruit of all Vedic literature. It is accepted by the Vedic tradition as the conclusion of Vedantic principles and understanding, and relates the pastimes and characteristics of the Supreme Lord.\n\nThe process of spiritual development described in the Vedic literature is one of a gradual process of God-realization and love of God. This wisdom has been carefully preserved and passed down through the centuries through the vehicle of the disciplic succession of self-realized teachers.\n\nThis ancient spiritual wisdom is now again being presented in the West through the Hare Krishna Movement. They invite people of all kinds to visit their temples, communities and websites, and participate in whatever way they like in this sublime and easy process of bhakti-yoga and Krishna Consciousness. There are also many books that can also help explain how you may begin this spiritual process."

  {
    "question": "Hare krishna and Hinduaism?",
    "answer": "The terms Hare Krishna and Hinduism are intimately connected, yet not synonymous. The word Hindu was first used by Persians to denote ‘those South of the Indus river’. It has come to include the many diverse strands of Indian and Vedic culture which make up Hinduism, the world’s third largest religion, with over 600 million practitioners worldwide. As such, ‘Hinduism’ describes not a single, monolithic religion, but a vast spectrum of spiritual paths, many tracing their origins to particular branches of the Vedas.\n\nBecause the teachings of Bhakti are rooted in the Vedas, Bhakti falls under the banner of Hinduism. Unlike most other Hindu philosophies and branches, for those practicing Bhakti believe in a personal relationship with the Lord who is considered to be the Supreme Person and source of all personal and impersonal energies. Just like a sun globe has form yet emanates heat and light that does not hold a form, the Supreme also has a personal form that emanates all varieties of energies.\n\nStrictly speaking, the word \"Hindu\" is not found in the Vedas - the spiritual scriptures of India. It was first used by Moghuls to refer to the people living east of the Sindhu River, in what is now India. When \"Hindu\" entered the English language in the seventeenth century, it was used to denote any native of Hindustan (India), but gradually came to mean someone who retained the indigenous religion (based on the Vedas) and had not converted to Islam.\n\nThe word ‘Veda’ literally means knowledge, and refers to the original Vedic shastras (scriptures) and civilisation, dating back many thousands of years. One of these shastras, the Bhagavad Gita, forms the philosophical and theological basis of the Hare Krishna Movement, and is often referred to as ‘The Bible of Hinduism.’\n\nHare Krishna is a major monotheistic tradition, known academically as vaishnavism or sanatana dhama, ‘the eternal teaching’. The core practice is bhakti (devotion) to Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is both a major strand of Hinduism, and a transcendental, non-sectarian and inclusive process applicable to any religious culture such as Christianity, Buddism, Judaism or Islam, all of which include devotional practices and branches."

    "question": "What is Chanting ‘Hare Krishna’?",
    "answer": "Devotees of Krishna chant the Hare Krishna mantra:\nHare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare\nHare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare\n\n– because the Vedas refer to it as the maha – mantra or ‘Great Mantra’. This sixteen-word mantra is especially recommended as the easiest method for self-realization in the present age.\n\nKrishna is a Sanskrit name of God meaning ‘all attractive’, and Rama is another name meaning ‘reservoir of pleasure’. The divine energy of God is addressed as Hare. Vedic knowledge teaches that since we are all constitutionally servants of God, the chanting of His names is not an artificial imposition on the mind but is as natural as a child calling for its mother. There are two ways to chant the maha mantra: group chanting (kirtan) and softly saying the mantra to oneself (japa). The latter is done by using a string of 108 wooden prayer beads to enhance concentration. In both methods there are no hard and fast rules, and anyone can chant with good results."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do you put such an emphasis on chanting ′Hare Krishna′?",
    "answer": "The main practice in awakening our spiritual nature is known as yagya, the turning around of our consciousness from self-centred to God-centred. It involves offering our words, wealth, time and intelligence to God. Some of this is done as part of daily life, and some is done in powerful ritualised practises.\n\nThere are four main ingredients for yagya and they have been practised, say the Vedas, from the very dawn of creation. The universe has four seasons that revolve over many millions of years. Each one of the four yagya activities is most appropriate for a particular season. The Spring of Satya Yuga requires meditation on Vishnu within the heart; for Treta Yuga fire sacrifices are most important; in the Dwapara Yuga opulent temple worship is the recommended process; but in the Winter Age of Kali Yuga the chanting of the ‘Names of Hari’ is the most effective yagya process.\n\nIndeed, the Brihan-Naradiya Purana says hari-nama eva kevalam: ‘the chanting of the holy name of Hari (Krishna) is the only way.’ When Sri Chaitanya appeared in India he promoted the chanting of the names of Krishna as both a personal practise and a collective, congregational and musical practise. The result of his teachings, and of those who followed him, is the modern-day Hare Krishna movement."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do you chant in the streets?",
    "answer": "Most scriptures of the world, and particularly the Vedas, extol the chanting of God’s names as a powerful means of spiritual realisation. Someone who enjoys their spiritual life naturally feels inclined to share it with others. This enthusiasm caused the founder of ISKCON to not only teach Krishna consciousness, but to organise his early students as a formal society for the purpose of teaching others. Devotees of Krishna, therefore will often be found in public places performing sankirtana, by chanting with musical instruments, as introduced by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 500 years ago."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is there suffering?",
    "answer": "The answer is Karma. Western science and philosophy explain that the law of causality governs all actions and events in the universe. Actions and events have corresponding reactions on the material platform. The Vedic texts, call this principle of action and reaction ‘karma’. The spirit soul, which is entrapped in the material nature, acts in particular ways which can cause it either further bondage or liberation from the laws of nature. An individual’s actions bring about his or her transmigration from one body to another. One cannot become free from karma simply by refraining from action. One has to learn the art of working without accruing karma, which is the process of bhakti yoga. or devotion to God."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is your stance on animal rights and the environment?",
    "answer": "Krishna consciousness is the most respectful philosophy of animal and environmental rights that exist in the world.\n\nDevotees are strictly vegetarian, we do not eat meat, fish or eggs. That immediately supports animal rights, because we respect their right to live. There is no need to kill animals for the satisfaction of our palates, as the trees and plants are bowing down with vegetables, fruit, grains and nuts for our meals. One may ask, how is it that we are killing the plants? Harvesting does not always kill the plant – apples can be reaped in every season from the same tree. We have to eat, so we take our meals from that kingdom from which we cause the least amount of distress and pain. Still eating vegetables just like that means there is some reaction, therefore devotees prepare, cook and offer vegetarian meals guided by spiritual principles of cooking given in the Vedas.\n\nVegetarianism and a simpler lifestyle sustains the environment. The meat industry contributes largely to deforestation, desertification, water pollution, water shortages, air pollution, and soil erosion. Half of the Amazon rain forests have been cleared for cattle ranching, 40% of the land in Western United States is used for rearing beef livestock, 50% of the world’s grain suitable for human consumption are fed to cattle whilst millions of humans remain starving and undernourished. All the soybean and grain fed to US livestock in a year could feed 1.3 billion people.\n\nMoreover, no other philosophy reveres the cow like the Vedes instruct. The cow is regarded as the mother of mankind as she sustains all with life giving milk. Devotees therefore protect the cow and will not even think of slaughtering her. Calves should have the first right to any milk that a mother cow produces, and whatever is left over is available to humans."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why be a Vegetarian?",
    "answer": "The Vedic scriptures establish nonviolence, called ahimsa, as the ethical foundation of vegetarianism and for a peaceful society. According to the Vedas, God is the Supreme Father of all creatures, not just humans. Therefore, slaughter of innocent animals is considered equivalent to killing one’s brother or sister.\n\nKrishna devotees follow a wholesome lacto-vegetarian diet excluding meat, fish and eggs. Although it may be argued that vegetarians are guilty of killing vegetables, foods such as fruits, nuts, milk, and grains do not require killing. But even when a plant’s life is taken, the pain involved is dramatically less than that of a highly-sensitive animal such as a cow or lamb.\n\nAccording to karma, nature’s law of action and reaction, human beings must suffer for any killing that is against God’s laws. For this reason, as well as to show recognition and appreciation for the supreme proprietor and supplier of all food, devotees prepare vegetarian meals as devotional offerings to Krishna, God. Then food is called prasadam (spiritual food), which can be fully enjoyed without karmic reaction."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why eat Prasadam?",
    "answer": "On the spiritual path those that are most inclined to lead a peaceful existence that respects the value of all life often adopts the vegetarian lifestyle.\n\nIt is in accordance with the yogic principle of ahimsa, which is to observe nonviolence and abstain from injuring any being in any way. However, in the process of bhakti-yoga, devotion goes beyond simple vegetarianism, and food becomes a method of spiritual progress. In the Krishna temples, food is offered to the Deities in a special sacrament, after which it becomes prasadam.\n\nThis means the mercy of the Lord. Thus, the food we eat after it is offered to the Lord becomes a means for our purification and spiritual development.\n\nDevotional service or Krishna consciousness is often described as a process of singing, dancing and feasting. But the feasting is done with spiritual food, Krishna prasadam.\n\nIn the Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna says, “All that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.” So offering what we eat to the Lord is an integral part of bhakti-yoga and makes the food blessed with spiritual potencies. Then such food is called prasadam, or the mercy of the Lord.\n\nThe Lord also describes what He accepts as offerings: “If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.” Thus, we can see that the Lord does not need anything, but if one offers fruits, grains, and vegetarian foods, He will accept it. The Lord does not accept foods like meat, fish or eggs, but only those that are pure and naturally available without harming others. So we offer what Krishna likes, not those items which are distasteful to Him. We also do not use garlic, onions, or mushrooms when we prepare food for Krishna.\n\nThe Lord is fully satisfied in Himself. He is the creator of all so everything is already His. He supplies us with food through nature, but we give thanks to Him by offering it back in a mood of loving devotion.\n\nSo if His devotee offers something with love, out of His causeless mercy Krishna accepts it. The Lord is never hungry for our food, but for the love and devotion we offer. And then He reciprocates with that love."

  {
    "question": "Why we don’t eat onion and garlic?",
    "answer": "According to Ayurveda, India's classic medical science, foods are grouped into three categories – sattvic, rajasic and tamasic – foods in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Onions and garlic, and the other alliaceous plants are classified as rajasic and tamasic, which means that they increase passion and ignorance.\n\nThose that subscribe to pure brahmana style cooking of India, including myself, and Vaishnavas – followers of Lord Vishnu, Rama and Krishna – like to only cook with foods from the sattvic category. These foods include fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs, dairy products, grains and legumes, and so on. Specifically, Vaisnavas do not like to cook with rajasic or tamasic foods because they are unfit to offer to the Deity.\n\nBack in the 1980's, in his research on human brain function, Dr Robert [Bob] C. Beck, DSc. found that garlic has a detrimental effect on the brain. He found that in fact garlic is toxic to humans because its sulphone hydroxyl ions penetrate the blood-brain barrier and are poisonous to brain cells.\n\nIt should be pointed out that Garlic and onion are avoided by spiritual adherents because they stimulate the central nervous system, and can disturb vows of celibacy.\n\nSimilar things are described in Ayurveda. 'As well as producing offensive breath and body odor, these (alliaceous) plants induce aggravation, agitation, anxiety and aggression. Thus they are harmful physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually."

    "question": "I feel that my belief in god is very shallow. How do I find out there is god?",
    "answer": "We can learn about existence of God in the same way as we know about the existence of an artist when we see a picture or about the existence of parents when we see a child. Therefore when we observe nature, her workings and laws - which means there must be a lawgiver - we know that the intelligence of her creator, God, surpasses our concepts and that this God must be a person because only a person has intelligence."

    "question": "If God is so wonderful, why was I sent here to suffer? If He can do anything, can't He get me out of here?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is true that God can do anything. But He will not interfere with our minute independence; He will not impose Himself on the living being. Our suffering in this world is due to the misuse of our own independence. We are going to have to face our own responsibilities in this regard and stop blaming God. The sufferings we are currently undergoing are like the suffering of the dreamer in a nightmare. Ultimately they have no reality nor do they affect the soul who is simply undergoing the dreamlike conditions of material life due to his misidentification of the self with the material body. One might still say that while the dreamer dreams his sufferings are very real to him. True. But there is another purpose to our sufferings. They are meant to gradually move us in the direction of inquiring into the problems of life and into our relationship with God. The ultimate suffering of the living being is the feeling of incompleteness and dissatisfaction that the part must feel unless it is in proper relation to the whole. We are all suffering in this world due to the fact that we have voluntarily separated ourselves from God and thus we will always feel unfulfilled, incomplete and unsatisfied, no matter how much we attempt to enjoy this world, because we are functioning artificially outside of our loving relationship with God."

    "question": "What is Yoga?",
    "answer": "The word yoga originated from the Sanskrit word \"yuj\" which means \"to link with\" or \"to unite\". What is to be linked or united? The atma and the Paramatma-the soul and the Supreme soul or Supersoul. This definition is well known and generally accepted but there is one major misconception about it: many inexperienced yogis and jnanis think that \"unite with\" is to be equated with \"to merge with\". Uniting, however, does not mean that the soul loses its individuality, but it means that the soul acts in accordance with the Supersoul. Each soul is the servant of the Supersoul-Krishna (God).\n\nThere are different yoga systems which can help us to reach this goal. The reason for the difference between the systems is that they are meant for particular ages and persons. Nevertheless they all have one goal in common: to become free from material bondage and to spiritualize the consciousness.\n\nPeople who are unfamiliar with the Vedic tradition of yoga see it as an exercise physically. Yoga does help in this way, but its main purpose is to help one regain their spiritual consciousness and 'link' again with God.\n\nThe Gita ultimately prescribes bhakti-yoga (the path of dedication and love) as the culmination of other yoga practices. Bhakti-yoga focuses on developing our dedication, service and love for the Divinity, Lord Krishna.\n\nThis process teaches one how to attain the Supreme through loving devotional service. In this way the goal of ALL the other yoga processes is easily achieved. Although it is the most direct and straight forward process to achieve the Supreme, it is the only one where the practitioner can be married. Having a Krsna conscious child is bhakti-yoga. All other processes strictly demand complete celibacy, are comparatively mechanical and offer only artificial sense control. One example is of Visvamitra Muni- he was mediatiting and became agitated by the ankle bells of the heavenly society girl, Menaka. He was no longer able to control his senses and fell down with her.\n\nBy chanting the Holy Names of the Lord, one is engaging in bhakti yoga and is able to achieve all perfection. Hari das Thakur, one of Lord Caitanya's intimate associates chanted 300,000 names of the Lord a day. He was approached by a prostitute who was Maya incarnate but he did not succumb to her advances and advised her to chant. The power of the Holy Name was so strong and potent, that she gave up prostitution, accepted Haridas Thakur as her spiritual master, and chanted 300,000 names of the Lord a day for the rest of her life.\n\nThe path of bhakti-yoga is developed through a variety of activities. These include mantra meditation, or the chanting of the names of God. The chanting is done either individually on beads (japa) or in community by chanting mantras accompanied by music (kirtan). The study of sacred texts such as the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, associating with like-minded spiritual aspirants, eating sanctified vegetarian food (prasadam), and living in a way that upholds the principles of truthfulness, mercy, austerity, and cleanliness, are all core practices for a life of follower of bhakti. Therefore, bhakti-yoga is in the true sense real yoga."

    "question": "What is Bhakti Yoga?",
    "answer": "The process of awakening love is not just purifying but also fully satisfying. This purification process consists of three main principles – Chanting, dancing & feasting.\n\nChanting of pure names of Lord can be done simply by regularly chanting Hare Krishna mahamantra – Hare Krishna Hare Krishna / Krishna Krishna Hare Hare / Hare Rama Hare Rama / Rama Rama Hare Hare. The chanting can be done as minimum fixed rounds on japa mala or it can be done together in congregation with musical instruments.\n\nBhakti is derived from the Sanskrit word bhaj, which means – loving service. Yoga in Sanskrit means – connection. Bhakti yoga means to connect to the supreme by means of loving pure devotional service.\n\nWe all have love or Bhakti within our self. However, it is in dormant state. There is a simple way to awaken this dormant loving service to the supreme personality of Godhead. This process is laid down by Lord Sri Krishna in Bhagavad Gita. Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahabrabhu, the incarnation of Lord Krishna in this present age has mercifully made this process very simple and enjoyable. Srila Prabhupada, the founder of ISKCON has made this process famous all over the world."

    "question": "What is pure devotional service?",
    "answer": "This is the most advanced form and the final goal of bhakti-yoga. It means to engage in bhakti-yoga without any material motivations like peace, residence in heaven, salvation, the Promised Land, prosperity, health & etc. Pure devotional service is absolute liberation and the one and only motivation is pure, spiritual devotion for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure devotee engaged in pure devotional service is beyond heaven, earth or hell. A heaven without devotional service he considers to be hell and a hell with devotional service he considers to be heaven. We have to be very careful never to imitate such a very advanced soul. Our first and foremost goal is to follow the instructions of the spiritual master. Pure devotional service is a gift from Krishna and He will bestow it if one sincerely follows the genuine spiritual master."

  {
    "question": "What is mixed devotional service?",
    "answer": "This is if someone engages in bhakti-yoga to gain something like heaven, salvation, peace, health etc. Most religious people are engaged in this form of bhakti-yoga. Mixed devotional service gradually leads to pure devotional service. Only the Vaisnavas know about the deeper meanings of devotion (love) for God. Someone intelligent enough should strive for pure devotional service by following the instructions of the genuine Vaisnava spiritual master, constantly chanting the Holy Name. For those on the superior path of pure devotional service it is advised not to mix with those who engage in mixed devotional service because the later are still polluted by various sinful behavior."

  {
    "question": "What is raganuga bhakti?",
    "answer": "Raganuga bhakti (spontaneous devotional service) is the advanced stage of bhakti-yoga which the devotee arrives at following the genuine spiritual master and reaching the stage of liberation after he has conquered his material attachments (anartha-nivritti). He realizes his individual svarupa (the eternal transcendental identity of the soul) and engages this transcendental identity (himself) in raganuga bhakti. This realization is not simply imagination or speculation, it is real and it is revealed in due time if someone sincerely engages in bhakti-yoga under the direction of a genuine spiritual master like Srila Prabhupada. Raganuga bhakti is not meant for the material body (the sahajiyas think the like and consequently dress as gopis or gopas, only scaring the people and deceiving the fools). Raganuga bhakti is for the eternal spiritual self. The spiritual self is most sacred and an advanced devotee would never talk about it in public, what to speak of dressing the abominable material body like an eternal resident of Vrindavana.\n\n“A devotee who is actually advanced in Krsna consciousness, who is constantly engaged in devotional service, should not manifest himself, even though he has attained perfection. The idea is that he should always continue to act as a neophyte devotee as long as his material body is there. Activities in devotional service under regulative principles must be followed even by the pure devotee. But when he realizes his actual position in relationship with the Lord, he can, along with the discharging of regulative service, think within himself of the Lord, under the guidance of a particular associate of the Lord, and develop his transcendental sentiments in following that associate.” (Nectar of Devotion 16)"

    "question": "What is the significance of Deities and Deity Worship?",
    "answer": "Many verses in the Puranas and particularly the Brahma-samhita establish that the Supreme Being does have specific forms according to His pastimes. These texts also describe His variegated features, which include His spiritual shape, characteristics, beauty, strength, intelligence, activities, etc. Therefore, it is considered that the authorized Deities of the Supreme that are shaped according to these descriptions provide a view of the personal form of God.\n\nThose who have no knowledge of God or His form will certainly consider the temple Deities as idols. But this is because they think that the Deities are simply the products of someone’s imagination. Of course, there are those who say that God has no form, spiritual or material, or that there is no Supreme Being.\n\nActually God is described in the Vedic literature, which explains that God is sat-chit-ananda vigraha, or the form of complete spiritual essence, full of eternity, knowledge, and bliss, and is not material in any way. His body, soul, form, qualities, names, pastimes, etc., are all nondifferent and are of the same spiritual quality.\n\nThis form of God is not an idol designed from someone’s imagination, but is the true form, even if He should descend into this material creation. And since the spiritual nature of God is absolute, He is nondifferent from His name. Thus, the name Krishna is an avatara or incarnation of Krishna in the form of sound.\n\nSimilarly, His form in the temple is not merely a representation, but is also qualitatively the same as Krishna as the archa-vigraha, or the worshipable form.\n\nSome people may question that if the Deity is made from material elements, such as stone, marble, metal, wood, or paint, how can it be the spiritual form of God? The answer is given that since God is the source of all material and spiritual energies, material elements are also a form of God. Therefore, God can manifest as the Deity in the temple, though made of stone or other elements, since He can transform what is spiritual into material energy, and material energy back into spiritual energy. Thus, the Deity can easily be accepted as the Supreme since He can appear in any element as He chooses. In this way, even though we may be unqualified to see God, who is beyond the perceptibility of our material senses, the living beings in this material creation are allowed to see and approach the Supreme through His archa-vigraha form as the worshipable Deity in the temple. This is considered His causeless mercy on the materially conditioned living beings.\n\nIn this manner, the Supreme Being gives Himself to His devotees so they can become absorbed in serving, remembering and meditating on Him. Thus, the Supreme comes to dwell in the temple, and the temple becomes the spiritual abode on earth. In time, the body, mind and senses of the devotee become spiritualized by serving the Deity, and the Supreme becomes fully manifest to him or her. Worshiping the Deity of the Supreme and using one’s senses in the process of bhakti-yoga, devotional service to the Supreme, provides a means for one’s true essential spiritual nature to unfold. The devotee becomes spiritually realized and the Deities reveal Their spiritual nature to the sincere souls according to their spiritual development."

    "question": "Why we wear Tilak?",
    "answer": "As anyone who is familiar with the Vedic tradition knows, many of its followers wear marking on the foreheads. This is called tilak. Some tilak markings are made with ash, some with clay or soil, some are red dots with kum kum, or dyed rice flour, or red dots with additional applications like a few grains of rice stuck to it. Some tilak appears as three lines of ash going horizontally across the forehead that indicates one is a Shaivite, or a small triangle on the nose with a \"V\" shape rising vertically up on the forehead from between the eyebrows, which indicates one is a Vaishnava. This is a sign of the foot of Lord Vishnu, recited while chanting the name of Lord Vishnu.\n\nThere are different reasons why this is done and what they mean, but here is a description of why Vaishnavas wear their tilok, especially with Gopi-candana (or Gopi Chand). Gopi Candana is the soil that comes from a place not far from Dwaraka.\n\nThe history is that this is the place where the gopis entered the river to leave their bodies after Lord Krishna left this planet to return to His spiritual abode. Thus, they also followed in this way. The mud that used to be the banks of that river is called Gopi-candana. Vaishnavas apply this mud while chanting the names of Vishnu in twelve places on the head, arms, chest and back.\n\nThe process marks the body as a temple, purifies the body, and also acts as protection from evil influences, ghosts, etc. By seeing this tilok on ourselves or other devotees, it serves as a constant reminder of Lord Krishna.\n\nTilak is also used in Deity worship, offered to the Deities and also used with lemon juice to polish brass deities."

    "question": "Why do we fall flat on the ground or offer Obeisance?",
    "answer": "1. Humility:\nKrishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the Supreme Creator and our Supreme father. We are His eternal devotees. Everything in this world is provided by Him. Thus we need to become humble and accept His Supremacy.\n\n2. Respect:\nJust as we respect our parents and elders, similarly we should offer our respect to the eldest of all persons: the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic tradition the best way to pay respect is by offering obeisances.\n\n3. Devotional Service:\nOffering obeisances is an important part of devotional service by which the devotee confirms his attitude of submission.\nGlories of offering obeisances stated in vedic scriptures\n\nSkanda Purana mentions the glories of offering obeisances to the supreme Personality of Godhead:\nOne, who has worshipped Vishnu or offered Him obeisances once, even neglectful, will go to Shri Vaikuntha Dhama which is worshipped by the demigods and is rare even for them.\n\nOne who bathes Shri Madhava with a conchshell full of Ganga water while saying, \"O Narayana! I offer obeisances unto you\", does not have to take birth again. He attains Vaikunthaloka.\n\n\"I offer my respectful obeisances to the Supreme Absolute Truth, Krishna, who is the well-wisher of the cows and the brahmanas as well as the living entities in general. I offer my repeated obeisances to Govinda, who is the pleasure reservoir for all the senses.\"\n\nSimply by offering obeisances to Lord Govinda, even once, one receives the merit of performing one hundred horse sacrifices. In fact, performers of sacrifices are undoubtedly born in this world again whereas those who offer obeisances to Lord Krishna never experience birth in the material world again.\n\nThis is a verse from the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14-8)\n\ntat te 'nukampāḿ su-samīkṣamāṇo\nbhuñjāna evātma-kṛtam\"vipākam\nhṛd-vāg-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te\njīveta yo mukti-pade sa dāya-bhāk\n\n\"My dear Lord, one who constantly waits for Your causeless mercy to be bestowed upon him and who goes on suffering the reactions of his past misdeeds, offering You respectful obeisances from the core of his heart, is surely eligible for liberation, for it has become his rightful claim.\"\n\nLord Siva speaking to Skanda, “Any person, who has seen Salagram Sila, paid obeisances to Him, bathed and worshipped Him, has achieved the results of performing ten million sacrifices and giving ten million cows in charity. — Skanda Purana – Haribhakti vilas"

    "question": "Why circumambulate Tulasi plant?",
    "answer": "The Tulasi tree is a most important plant, and is often seen at numerous Vedic temples, especially those dedicated to Vishnu and Krishna. At such temples you are likely to find one or more in the courtyard wherein pilgrims circumambulate it, water it, or even offer prayers to it. It is said that Tulasi will not grow well where there is no devotion to the Lord. In fact, how well Tulasi grows is said to be like a barometer that indicates how high the devotional attitude is of the devotee community around the temple.\n\nVaishnava devotees also use the wood to make neck beads and wear two or three strands of them around their necks signifying their devotion to the Lord. They also make their japa mala or chanting beads from wood of the Tulasi tree. Tulasi is considered to be a pure devotee of the Lord who has taken the form of a tree, and is very dear to Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu (Krishna) likes to wear garlands made of Tulasi leaves. Often sandalwood paste and Tulasi leaves are placed on the lotus feet of the Deity of Lord Vishnu/Krishna. Therefore she is given the utmost respect. This is also why many devotees and Hindus in general also grow Tulasi in their homes. In this way, the Tulasi plant plays an important part in the spiritual life of many devotees. So what is the significance, history and legends behind this little tree?\n\nAlthough we can never fully describe the glories of Tulasi-devi, an eternal associate of Lord Krsna. The scriptures give us a hint of the value of worshiping her. The following list comes from the Padma Purana.\n\nTulasi is the essence of all devotional activities.\n\nThe leaves, flowers, roots, bark, branches, trunk, and shade of Tulasi-devi are all spiritual.\n\nOne who with devotion applies the paste of Tulasi wood to the Deity of Krsna will always live close to Krsna.\n\nOne who puts mud from the base of the Tulasi tree on his body and worships the Deity of Lord Krsna gets the results of one hundred days worship each day.\n\nOne who offers a Tulasimanjari to Lord Krsna gets the benefit of offering all other varieties of flowers, and he goes to the abode of Krsna.\n\nOne who sees or comes near a house or garden where the Tulasi plant is present gets rid of all his sinful reactions, including that of killing a brahmana.\n\nLord Krsna happily lives in the house, town, or forest where Tulasi-devi is present.\n\nA house where Tulasi-devi is present never falls on bad times, and it becomes purer than all holy places.\n\nThe fragrance of Tulasi-devi purifies all who smell it.\n\nLord Krsna and all the demigods live in a house where mud from the base of the Tulasi tree is found.\n\nWithout Tulasi leaves, Lord Krsna does not like to accept flowers, food, or sandalwood paste.\n\nOne who worships Lord Krsna daily with Tulasi leaves attains the results of all kinds of austerity, charity, and sacrifice. In fact, he has no other duties to perform, and he has realized the essence of the scriptures.\n\nOne who puts into his mouth or on his head Tulasi leaves that have been offered to Lord Krsna attains Lord Krsna's abode.\n\nIn Kali-yuga, one who worships, remembers, plants, keeps, or performs kirtana before Tulasi burns up all sinful reactions and quickly attains Lord Krsna's abode.\n\nOne who worships Lord Krsna with Tulasi leaves releases all his ancestors from the realm of birth and death.\n\nOne who remembers the glories of Tulasi or tells others about them will never take birth again."

    "question": "Why do we wear Neck-beads(Kanti mala)?",
    "answer": "Devotees of Krishna wear Tulasi (ocimum sanctum wood) neck beads, often as three strands at the base of the neck. Tulasi beads worn around the neck indicate a devotee's surrender to the Lord; such a person is dear to the Lord.\n\nTulasi beads are said to protect one from bad dreams, accidents, attack by weapons, and inauspicious destinations at death. For these reasons and because she is dear to Krishna, devotees always wear Tulasi.\n\nSrila Prabhupada states,\nIn the Padma Purāna there is a statement describing how a Vaisnava should decorate his body with tilaka and beads: \"Persons who put tulasī beads on the neck, who mark twelve places of their bodies as Visnu temples with Visnu's symbolic representations [the four items held in the four hands of Lord Visnu—conch, mace, disc and lotus], and who have visnu-tilaka on their foreheads, are to be understood as the devotees of Lord Visnu in this world. Their presence makes the world purified, and anywhere they remain, they make that place as good as Vaikuntha.\"\n\nIn response to a list of several question asked by disciple Vidyadasi, SrilaPrabhupada replies:\n“Tulasi is one devotee who appears wherever there is devotion to Krsna. Tulasi’s body is spiritual. Tulasi leaves should be offered to the Deity.”\n\nSrila Prabhupada has also said,\n“Just as a pet dog has got a collar, similarly we are pet dogs of God. So we have got this collar. And Yamaraja, the Lord of Death will understand that he-the devotee-is God's dog; he should not be shot down.\n\nBecause Tulasikanthi is so important they are never taken off, but they can be replaced. Anyone who wears Tulasineckbeads at the time of death is greatly benefited beyond imagination, therefore it is important to keep them on at all times. Tulasi also identifies one as a follower of Lord Chaitanya.\n\nSrila Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings in his Svīkara: Acceptance of Activities Favorable to Pure Devotion –\nGaura-bhakta-priya-veśadadhānā\nTilaka-tulasī-mālā-śobhamānā\nI will put on the garb that is dear to the devotees of Lord Gaura-sundara, including the twelve Vaisnavatilaka markings on my body and beautiful beads of tulasī wood around my neck.\n\nSrila Bhaktivinoda Thakur also writes in his Jaiva Dharma that of the 64 angas of devotional service the remaining fourty-four are observed to increase one’s bhakti. Item number one is decoration of the body with the Vaisnava signs of tilaka and tulasī beads.\n\nQ. One may ask that if we are not the body then what is the need of instructions of decoration of the body?\n\nA. Yes we are not the body but unless are Paramahamsa pure devotees then we are still conditioned by the body. We don’t want to become falsely transcendental and reject those good things that the greatly intelligent pure devotees has suggested for our spiritual welfare. Yes, if we are not the body then we also do not need to eat, but because this body is Krishna’s property we take care of it and because this body is Krishna’s property we decorate it in vedic way."

    "question": "Why do we circumambulate (Pradakshina) the Temple and Deities?",
    "answer": "We cannot draw a circle without a centre point. The Lord is the centre, source and essence of our lives. We acknowledge this by performing Pradakshina recognizing him as the focal point in our lives and go about doing our daily chores. This is the significance of Pradakshina.\n\nAlso, every point on the circumference of a circle is equidistant from the centre. This means that wherever we may be or whoever we may be, we are equally close to the lord. His grace flows towards us without partiality.\n\nSkanda Purana chapter 9 Verse 68 – In the word Pra-da-ksi-na, the syllable Pra dispels sin, the syllable Da bestows what is desired, the syllable Ksi causes the destructions of Karma and the syllable Na is the bestower of salvation.\n\nWhy is Pradakshina done in a clockwise manner?\n\nHindus go round the sanctum sanctorum in the temple and sometimes the deities in the puja or yajnya at home in a clockwise direction. We always assume God is the centre of our existence. He also exists everywhere so when we do Pradakshina or circumambulation we accept that our actions and thoughts are always centered around God. The centre point is always fixed and remains the same at whatever distance we do the pradakshina so we are reminded of the eternal truth that God is the centre of Gravity and the main focus of our existence this is the main principle of Pradakshinam.\n\nFurther he makes Pradakshinas (devotional rounds) slowly with folded hands and visualizing the Diety in his mind all the time. All these action knowingly or unknowingly have salutary effect to ward off the ego from the mind of the Devotee. It is not worthy that the purpose of temple worship is never achieved unless one understands that visits to temples are meant to help the devotee to shed his ego. The purpose of visits to temples is one's own cultural emancipation which functions on fundamental values known as Dharma.\n\nIt is normal to do Pradakshinam always in clockwise direction. This is because we assume that the Lord is always on our right side. This reminds us we must always lead a righteous life, in the right path called Dharma."

    "question": "Why do we take off our shoes before entering the Temple?",
    "answer": "Shoes move on various surfaces both dirty and clean. This cleanliness is of prime necessity to preserve the sanctity of the temple, which is the holy home of God. Temple is a home of GOD, we must maintain the cleanliness.\nMoreover when we go to a temple or approach the holy temple altar at home, our mental state and status should be quite different.\n\nIf we take off the shoes or other footwear, together with all our mental darkness, ego and crookedness and then if we enter the temple and approach God, the receptive capacity of the mind would increase. It will be highly beneficial for us if we keep out the bundle of worldly thoughts together with our shoes or footwear outside and then practice meditation and devotion.\n\nIf you forget our eternal miseries and surrender to God, the journey of life would be worthwhile. For realizing God we need to keep our egos outside. Some people have a fetish for shoes. We also tend to judge people on what brand of footwear they wear. Hence when one enters the temple all these external judgements and likes or dislikes are left outside as each one is a child God.\n\nRemoving shoes outside a temple is a gesture of being both symbol and a conscious desire to leave behind the outer world by shedding, literally, the first obvious steps—shoes."

    "question": "Why do we ring the temple bell?",
    "answer": "Most of the old temples in India have a large bell at the entrance that one needs to ring before entering the temple. Making temple bells is a whole science. These bells are not made out of ordinary metal, but a whole variety of them, including cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, nickel, chromium and manganese.\n\nThe proportion at which each one of them mixed is the real science behind making a bell. Each of these bells is made to produce such a distinct sound that it can create a harmony between your left and right brains. The moment you ring that bell, it produces a sharp but lasting sound vibration which lasts for minimum of seven seconds in echo mode — long enough to touch your seven healing centers (or chakras) in your body.\n\nThe Bell, known in Sanskrit as the Ghanta/Ghanti is used in all poojas for invoking the Gods. The ringing of the bell produces what is regarded as an auspicious sound. It produces the sound of \"OM\" the Universal name of the Lord. Most Mantras (prayers) and vedic chants start with OM. All auspicious actions begin with OM. It fills the mind with peace, makes it focussed and replete with subtle sounds. The ringing of the bell drowns any irrelevant or inauspicious sound, and pervades the whole atmosphere. This reminds us of all pervasive nature of the supreme (Sarva-vyapi). Even while performing ‘Aarati’ the bell is rung. It is sometimes accompanied by blowing conch, beating drums, playing cymbals and other musical instruments.\n\nThe moment the bell rings your brain is emptied of all thoughts. Invariably, you will enter a state of trance where you are very receptive.\n\nThe bell works as an anti-dote to the chaos of your mind. Before you enter the temple it helps you to calm down & prepares you for the spiritual awareness you are going to experience.\n\nEven while doing the ritualistic arati, we ring the bell. It is sometimes accompanied by the auspicious sounds of the conch and other musical instruments. An added significance of ringing the bell, conch and other instruments is that they help drown any inauspicious or irrelevant noises and comments that might disturb or distract the worshippers in their devotional ardor, concentration and inner peace."

    "question": "Why we blow Conch or Shankha?",
    "answer": "When the conch (Shankha) is blown, the primal sound of Om emerges. Om is the sound that was emanated by God before creation of the universes.\n\nThe conch (sankha) is one of the attributes of Lord Vishnu. It is said that once a demon name Sankhasura harassed the Demigods and stole the Vedas and hid himself in an ocean. Lord Visnu incarnated as a huge golden fish ie Matsya Avatar and killed the demon. After this the Lord is supposed to have blown the conch- shaped bone of the ear of Sankhasura. From this, arose the sound Om and from this sound emerged the Vedas. The conch is therefore known as sankha after Sankhasura. The conch of Lord Vishnu or Lord Krishna is called the Pancajanya. It represents dharma or righteousness, which is one of the four objectives (purusarthas) of human life. The sound of the conch also symbolises the victory of the good over the evil.\n\nConches also have been blown during aratis and important festivals in temples to serve as a reminder to those villagers or citizens who had missed the worship. The sound of the conch helps people to make their minds concentrate on God while praying and drive away other stray thoughts. The conch is placed in temples and even in domestic shrines as a symbol of Nada Brahma or the sound of Om, the Vedas, dharma, victory and auspiciousness. It is also at times used to give tirtha water (holy water) to devotees in a temple.\n\nBecause of its close association with Lord Vishnu, the blowing of the conch is an essential part of Vaishnavite ritual practices.\n\nIt is believed the blowing shankha destroys enemies and also pleases goddess Lakshmi.\n\nNot just for religion, blowing shankha has scientific and ayurvedic benefits also. As per them, blowing shankha during puja has benefits on our lungs. This is because for blowing a shankha pure air reaches the lungs and impure air comes out. This makes the lungs strong.\n\nBlowing shankha also cures diseases of intestines."

    "question": "Why wear robes and saris?",
    "answer": "In the ancient Vedic culture a person dressed according to his or her social and spiritual position. Following those traditions, women who live in Hare Krishna communities wear saris and men wear robes called dhotis. Married men wear white, and unmarried men wear saffron. Men living a monastic lifestyle shave their heads and leave a tuft of hair in the back, called a sikha. This is done as a sign of renunciation and surrender to Krishna, as well as for cleanliness and simplicity. The sikha is also a sign of accepting the premise that God is a person and not merely an impersonal force. The clay marking on the forehead signifies that the body is a temple of God. The clay comes from sacred rivers in India."

So, those who need to perform vedic rituals are advised to remove hairs.\n\nHowever, there are many reasons for having SHIKHA:\n1. When Devotee leaves body Krishna pulls the soul from the top most Chakra which is on the head under the shikha.\n\n2. It is said that according to the karma of a soul the living entity at the time of death leaves body from different places from mouth, nose, etc… But a devotee who leaves this body from that “chakra” (Shikha) attains high planets of Spiritual world.\n\n3. Also hair is needed to protect that chakra. But women do not cut their hair, because their other lower chakras are not good protected but if they have long hair they protect them with hair.\n\n4. The Vaishnavas following a descending spiritual path that is they depend on the mercy of the Supreme Lord at every step to pull them out of Maya. So when we are drowning in Maya and only our head is out of the water, Guru and Gauranga can still pull us out comfortably by holding our head by this tuft of head called the shikha. So the shikha shows the subordination and dependence of the devotee on the causeless mercy of Lord Gauranga-Krishna at all times.\n\n5. The Mayavadis follow the ascending path since they are egotistically confident of achieving God and coming out of illusion by the dint of their insignificant efforts or sadhan. So they do not keep a shikha because they do not need the mercy of the Lord.\n\n6) Shikha is also like a spiritual antenna on the top of the head meant to show to the Lord and that we are aspiring recipients of His causeless mercy.\n\n7) One must have a shikha to perform any kind of yajna. Therefore in Indian tradition all the brahmanas, Vaisnava or otherwise, keep a shikha. Although there seem to be no shastric injunctions regarding the size of the shikha, GaudiyaVaisnavas traditionally keep the shikha about the size of a calf's hoofprint, approximately 1.5 inches (5 – 6 cm.) in diameter.\n\n8) SrilaPrabhupada mentioned this in a conversation with some of his disciples in Hawaii (6.5.1972):\n“GaudiyaVaisnavasikha is an inch and a half across — no bigger. Bigger sikha means another sampradaya…. And they have to be knotted”\n\n9) SrilaPrabhupadaLilamrta says:\nThe sikha may be any length, but it should be kept tightly knotted and only untied when you are washing, The Hari-bhakti-vilasa observes that members of the upper classes even tie the sikha before taking the final ablutions of a bath. This particularly applies when bathing in a body of water such as a river or a lake, in which case to not tie the sikha prior to bathing is considered low class and disrespectful to the sacred rite of bathing.\n\nYou may tie it in a simple manner for bathing, retying it more carefully after the bath.* cleaning, or oiling it. Also, when going to sleep, attending funeral rites, or observing a period of mourning, you should keep the sikha untied. Since an untied sikha is a sign of a death in the family, it is inauspicious to go about one's daily duties with an untied sikha. It is also said that if one keeps the sikha untied, the body maybecome weak.\n\nWhile tying your sikha after bathing, chant the Hare Krsna mantra, or, if initiated with Gayatri mantras, silently chant the Brahma-gayatri (first line of Gayatri). The sikha should not be braided (traditionally only women braid their hair), nor should it be kept long and disheveled. Naturally, if the sikha is too short to be tied, it is all right to leave it open, but it should not be disheveled.\n\n10) Significance of Shaving head – It is a symbol of renunciation. If you see materialists, they are extremely fond of hair. Decorating hair etc pulls us into bodily consciousness. This is not good for practicing spiritualists. So as an indication of renunciation from material consciousness devotees shave head.\n\n11) Significance of shikha – Another view: It is a symbol of duality of souls and supreme Lord. Impersonalists believe that there is no duality between the supreme and the living entity and they are expected to shave their heads completely. Vaishnavites believe in the philosophy that there is clear and eternal distinction between supreme god Krishna and living entities. The shikha is symbol of Krishna which is large and the remaining very little hair is the symbol of insignificant and innumerable conditioned living entity\n\n12) SCIENTIFIC REASONS FOR HAVING SHIKHA:\n(A) A person who keeps SHIKHA attracts cosmic energy which imparts enlightment.\n(B) The small portion of hair that hangs from behind our head applies little pressure on our brains that helps one to improve concentration and mind control and improve memory."

    "question": "Who is Krishna?",
    "answer": "In the philosophy of Bhakti Yoga, the Absolute Truth is known as a person. His name is Krishna, a Sanskrit word which means “all attractive”.\n\nKrishna is the all attractive object of your soul’s love. Every living being is seeking pleasure. The essence of pleasure is the pleasure of love. We need it. Without loving someone and being loved by someone, life is very empty and superficial. The origin of that love is the soul’s love for God and God’s love for the soul. We are attracted by someone who is beautiful, someone who is powerful, someone who is learned, someone who is famous, someone who is renounced, someone who has wealth. These are opulences that attract our heart. The name Krishna means, he possesses all opulences in full. He is the source all beauty, all strength, all knowledge, all"
