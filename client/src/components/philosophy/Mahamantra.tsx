            One who chants the holy name of the Lord is immediately freed from the reactions of unlimited sins, even if he chants indirectly [to indicate something else], jokingly, for musical entertainment, or even neglectfully. This is accepted by all the learned scholars of the scriptures.

            Imagine how blessed we are!! Just to make fun of The Hare Krishna Movement, children on the streets in America, used to say: “Hey, see the Hare Krishnas are going!” and Prabhupada used to gladly smile at them. He protested when other devotees would try to scold these children, because of the understanding of the above mentioned verse..

            We cannot fathom how fortunate we are. The mercy of Lord Krishna is overflowing and never ending, especially in Kali Yuga: the age of quarrel and hypocrisy….

            “After searching through all the Vedic literature, one cannot find a method of religion more sublime for this age than the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa.”

            Prabhupada says: "One may or may not know the value or language of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, but if one somehow or other chants it, he will immediately be purified, just as one who takes a potent medicine will feel its effects, regardless of whether he takes it knowingly or unknowingly."
                        (Srimad-Bhagavatam 6.2.19, Purport)



            “ When we hear the transcendental vibration (of Hare Krishna Mahamantra), the seed of Krishna Consciousness (originally there in everyone, but in a dormant stage) is revived. And the process is recommended by authorities for this Age.
            By practical experience also, we can perceive that by chanting this maha-mantra, or the “Great Chanting for Deliverance,” one can at once feel transcendental ecstasy from the spiritual stratum.
            There is no need of understanding the language of the mantra, nor is there any need of mental speculation nor any intellectual adjustment for chanting this maha-mantra. It springs automatically from the spiritual platform, and as such, anyone can take part in this transcendental sound vibration, without any previous qualification, and dance in ecstasy.
            We have seen it practically. Even a child can take part in the chanting..
            The three words, namely Hara, Krishna and Rama, are transcendental seeds of the maha-mantra, and the chanting is a spiritual call for the Lord and His internal energy, Hara, for giving protection to the conditioned soul. The chanting is exactly like a genuine cry by the child for the mother.
            Mother Hara helps in achieving the grace of the supreme father, Hari, or Krishna, and the Lord reveals Himself to such a sincere devotee.
            No other means, therefore, of spiritual realization is as effective in this Age, as chanting the maha-mantra”.
                (Purport by Srila Prabhupada on hare Krishna Mahamantra)

There is no other way.’ ”In the vedic scriptures, there are so many examples of those who have got liberated by chanting the holy names of Lord Hari. One such brāhmaṇ is Ajamila who although born into a brahmin family, married and was practicing religious principles, fell down from his great position just because of sight of an illicit act. He gave up the company of his chaste wife and children, left the responsibility of caring his parents and brought home a prostitute. To maintain the prostitute, he even started stealing. With the prostitute he beget many children and the last son’s name was ‘Narayan’. At the time of his death, he helplessly called out for his son ‘Nārāyan, Nārāyan…’ and thus was liberated from being punished by Yamaraj. The Śrimad Bhāgavatam describes thus:'

              text: 'Ajāmila has already atoned for all his sinful actions. Indeed, he has atoned not only for sins performed in one life but for those performed in millions of lives, for in a helpless condition he chanted the holy name of Nārāyaṇa. Even though he did not chant purely, he chanted without offense, and therefore he is now pure and eligible for liberation. There is further description that, “The ritualistic ceremonies of atonement recommended in the religious scriptures are insufficient to cleanse the heart absolutely because after atonement one’s mind again runs toward material activities. Consequently, for one who wants liberation from the fruitive reactions of material activities, the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, or glorification of the name, fame, and pastimes of the Lord, is recommended as the most perfect process of atonement because such chanting completely eradicates the dirt from one’s heart. “At the time of death, Ajāmila helplessly and very loudly chanted the holy name of Nārāyaṇa. That chanting alone has already freed him from the reactions of all sinful life. Therefore, O servants of Yamarāja, do not try to take him to your master for punishment in hellish conditions. It is clear how the Holy Name is a savior for any of us in any situation in any condition. The chanting of Hare Krishna Mahamantra doesn’t require any kind of purifications and anyone in any situation can just do it. According to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s instructions, one should not wait to purify himself before chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. Whatever our condition may be, we should begin chanting immediately. By the power of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, we will gradually be relieved from all material contamination and will get shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, the ultimate goal of life. (Chaitanya Charitamrita Madhya 22.199 Purport). There are so many mentions in the Vedic Scriptures about the Glories of chanting Hare Krishna.'
