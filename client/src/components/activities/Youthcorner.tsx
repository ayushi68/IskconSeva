            Based on the teachings of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Hare Krishna Movement (HKM) Bhilai has been presenting the treasure house of spiritual knowledge to youth through 'Friends Of Lord Krishna' (FOLK). Folk envisions a society of dynamic young men and women, ready to live a life of values, culture and devotion to God. Our mission is to empower everyone with knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita that helps to differentiate between truth and illusion; revive faith that is based on scientific principles, logic and self-realization.

            The FOLK program provides spiritual and value sessions on weekends. On every Sunday hundreds of students gather for spiritual classes which also consist of music, dance and not to forget Prasadamâ€”delicious food offered to Lord Krishna.

            Places of pilgrimage yield a special advantage for a devotee in quickly advancing his spiritual life. Lord Krishna lives everywhere, but still it is very easy to approach Him in holy places of pilgrimage because these places are inhabited by great sages. Visiting a holy place of pilgrimage means neutralizing the reactions of sinful life. The holy places all over the earth are meant for purifying the polluted consciousness of the human being by an atmosphere surcharged with the presence of the Lord's pure devotees.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
            Hare Krishna Movement Bhilai conducts pilgrimage trips for the FOLK participants regularly to the places as Rajim, Champaran, Jagannath Puri, Mayapur, Vrindavan, Ahobilam, Tirupati, Shri Rangam and other pilgrimage places. It provides a wonderful opportunity to visit various holy places in different parts of the country.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
            The pilgrimages are conducted by senior devotees of temple who ensure that pilgrims get a memorable and devotionally inspiring experience through these tours. In addition to good accommodation, transportation and prasadam, you also get to learn about the significance of holy places and the pastimes of the Lord and His devotees associated to those places.
